Hello! I'm **cygni**. I like interactive fiction and video games.

I make small games in Twine and Bitsy and collaborate on visual novels, which are available on my [itch page](https://cygni.itch.io/).

I currently have a WIP in Twine and I share updates/demos of it on my [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cygni).

I'd love to collaborate on an IF, VN, or narrative-focused game as a writer or editor. Or just help with CSS in Twine. You can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/cygni_a)!
