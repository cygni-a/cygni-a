Hello! I'm **cygni**. I like interactive fiction and video games.

I make small games in Twine, Bitsy and Ren'py, which are available on my [itch page](https://cygni.itch.io/).

I'd love to collaborate on an IF, VN, or narrative-focused game as an editor or producer. You can reach me on [bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/cygni-a.bsky.social)!
